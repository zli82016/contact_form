# contact_form
A Contact UI page with aheader and a form is built.

Also, some error checking is added such as:
• check email for correct format
• check accepted characters
• all fields are required to allow user to click <send>

The page validates the input in real-time, displaying a green check if the input is accepted.
Once all required fields contain valid input, the <send> button becomes active.

Once a user clicks <send>, a success message should be displayed.
